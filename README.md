# Replication_MB

This is the code accompanying with the paper Dai and Yan (2023+). The package implements Mahalanobis balancing is https://github.com/yimindai0521/ACBalancing.

# file description:
**`covbal.R` include the source code of the weighting method.  

**`si.data.R`** is used for generating simulation data.

**`main.R`** is the main function for simulation.
